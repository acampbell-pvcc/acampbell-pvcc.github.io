            <li>Phase 3: Write the program code in appropriate language based on the algorithm.</li>

                <li>Decision structures: if/then/else </li>
                <li> Iterative (Looping): While loop: continue looping as long something is true.</li>
                <li>Repeat/Until Loop: continue looping until something is true</li>
                <li>For loop: loop a given number of times.</li>

                    <li>Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</li>
                    <li>Searching: Find specific data that meets a certain criteria</li>
                    <li>In database:
                    <li>Filters: temporary search</li>
                    <li>Queries: search criteria are saved so they dont have to be recreated.</li>
                    <li>Two Popular Search Techniques:</li>
                    <li>Sequential SearchL Search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time.</li>
                    <li>Binary Search: only works if data is SORTED first. Start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>

                            <li>Kinds of Test:</li>
                            <li>Acceptance Testing:Verifying whether the whole system works as intended.</li>
                            <li>Integration Testing:Ensuring that software components or functions operate together.</li>
                            <li>Unit Testing:Validating that each software unit performs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application.</li>
                            <li>Fuctional Testing:Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements. Black-box testing is a common way to verify functions.</li>
                            <li>Performance Testing:Testing how the software performs under different workloads. Load testing, for example, is used to evaluate performance under real-life load conditions.</li>
                            <li>Regression Testing:Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality. Sanity testing can be used to verify menus, functions and commands at the surface level, where there is no time for a full regression test.</li>
                            <li>Stress Testing:Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails. Considered to be a type of non-functional testing.</li>
                            <li>Usability Testing:Validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task.</li>
                            <li>Software testing is done to detect:</li>
                            <li>Architechtural flaws</li>
                            <li>Poor design decisions</li>
                            <li>Invalid of incorrect functionality</li>
                            <li>Security vulnerabilities</li>
                            <li>Scalability issues</li>

                            <li>Continuous testing:A software development process in which applications are tested continuously throughout the entire software development life cycle.</li>
                            <li>Configuration Management:The process of maintaing systems, such as computer hardware in a desired state.</li>
                            <li>Servic Virtualization:A method to emulate the behavior of specific componenets in heterogenerous component based applications.</li>
                            <li>Defect or "bug tracking":The process of logging and monitoring bugs or errors during software testing.</li>
                            <li>Metrics and Reporting:A standard of measure to a degree which a software system or process possesses some property.</li>
